## UI Suggestions

It is highly advisable to use light colors on black ground and not to use grey color on black background as used in the application in dark theme [Dark Theme screenshot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gEcnE9O6IcsBPmIzPdyPeO9xlfR6fQ8Z/view?usp=drive_link) [Dark Theme screenshot2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hxrJkUxoHN7jORKTaKpTuOtyyLF0fm9T/view?usp=sharing)

# Part 3

## Project Title [UI Automation]

[Swag Labs](https://www.saucedemo.com/) web UI automation testing with selenium java designed in Page Object Model design pattern.

## Prerequisites

Knowledge of Java, Selenium, Maven & Test NG

## Built With

- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) - The programming language used
- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/) - The web framework used
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
- [Test NG](https://testng.org/) - a testing framework for the Java programming language

## Running the tests

- To run these tests we should have any integrated development environment that can run java programs
- These tests are designed that they can all be run successively or each suite seperately or each test case seperately
- These tests consist of e2e tests folder which is responsible for running different user scenarios (standard user, locked_out_user, ....etc)

- These tests consist of testsuites for loginPage and productPage specifically which can test these pages seperately or can be used as regression cases if certain changes occured in these pages

## Test Scenarios:-
